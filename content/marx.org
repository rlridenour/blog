* Economics

** Commodities

- Objects produced for market exchange.
- Requires
  - Market
  - Division of labor



** Value

- Use value: usefulness
- Exchange value: how many A's is a B worth?

** Labor theory of value

- What makes x A's = y B's?
- Marx: the labor required to produce them.


** Puzzle



- I have 4 oranges, $3 each.
- You have 12 apples, $1 each.
- We trade 1 orange for 3 apples.
- Both start with $12 of value.
- End with $12 of value.
- How do we make profit?


** Answer

- Capitalism
  - Buy commodities
  - Convert to other commodities
  - Sell at higher price
  - How?
- Exploiting the worker
  - *NOT* immoral




** Labor

- Necessary labor
- Surplus labor



** Necessary labor

- C buys 1 day labor from W.
- Labor has exchange value
  - The labor required to keep W alive for 1 day
  - Less than 1 day's labor
- Necessary labor

** Surplus labor


- C gets 1 day's labor
- Pays for less than 1 day's labor
- Difference is surplus labor
- Surplus labor = surplus value
- Surplus value = profit

** Wages

- Increased profit = decreased wages
- Wages fall to subsistence level, not below
- Why?

** Predicted consequences

1. Automation = falling profit
2. Falling profit \(\rightarrow\) failure of capitalism
3. Labor intensive industries have higher rates of profit. (False)



** Morality

- Capitalism is good
  - Generates wealth
  - Need superabundance for communism
  - Unsustainable
- Final revolution \(\rightarrow\) communism
  - "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need."



** Objections to Macro-theory

1. Failure of communist states
   1. Weak objection: They didn't have the period of capitalist growth Marx thought necessary.
2. No revolution in capitalist nations
   1. Marx didn't foresee the extent of government economic intervention
3. Must profit rates fall?
   1. Empirical question
4. Technology /could/ increase profit.




** Problems

- People use subjective comparisons
- Information problem
- Superabundance impossible


** Marx's critique of markets

- Markets are biased to the status quo
- Injustice in, then injustice out
- Failure of Marx's positive theory doesn't negate Marx's negative criticism.

** Marx on freedom

- Commitment to freedom
- Freedom = power to quit


** Neo-Marxism

- Criticism of traditional property rights.
- Concentration of economic power---increased rich/poor gap.
- Influence of money in politics.
