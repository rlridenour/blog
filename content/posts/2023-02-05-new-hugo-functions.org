Here are some new functions for automating Hugo in Emacs, using some code from others that I modified slightly to fit my own needs.

This is from [[https://whatacold.io/blog/2022-10-10-emacs-hugo-blogging/][Ken Huang]]. With it, you can select a tag from a list of tags used on the site, then insert it into the right place in the front-matter.
