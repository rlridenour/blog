I found some some new functions for automating Hugo in Emacs, that I was able to modify slightly to fit my own needs.

[[https://whatacold.io/blog/2022-10-10-emacs-hugo-blogging/][Ken Huang]] has a nice function to select a tag from a list of tags used on the site, then insert it into the right place in the front-matter. Look at this post from [[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/create-websites-with-org-mode-and-hugo/][Peter Prevos]], for inserting links to other pages in the site. With it, you're able to just  ~C-c C-l~ to bring up a list of link types, select "hugo", then pick the file name of the page you want to link.

They both have some other useful things that might also be helpful. I'm grateful to others who solve problems they have and post the code online. I know just enough Emacs-lisp to figure out what is going on, and modify something to my own particular use-case, but not enough to be able to start from scratch.
