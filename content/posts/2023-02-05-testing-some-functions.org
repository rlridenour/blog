I'm testing some a couple of new functions. One is to add a tag to a post by selecting from a list of tags used on the site, like [[{{< ref 2023-02-04-venn-diagrams-in-latex.org >}}][this]]. Another is for inserting links to other pages on the site using ~org-insert-link~. The last updates the last modified date when a post is published.

Everything seems to be working fine.
