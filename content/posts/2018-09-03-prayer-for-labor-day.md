Father, We pray for those who labor, For those who are blessed  
to do what they love, For those who do what they must  
in order to simply survive. For those with hands as rough  
as the son of a carpenter, For those with backs as bent  
as the one who bore a cross  
through the streets of Jerusalem, And for those who have been  
shamed, despised and humiliated,  
while serving at earthly tables,  
patiently and humbly waiting  
for a seat at the heavenly banquet. _Amen_
